-- Basic SQL commands

SHOW DATABASES;   -- To Display all DATABASE
CREATE DATABASE [db_name]; -- To CREATE New DATABASE
DROP DATABASE [db_name]; --Â To delete the DATABASE
USE DATABASE [db_name]; --TO USE Specific DATABASE

-- Table Functions / Commands
CREATE Table [table_name]([col1] col1Type(size) extra, etc...);
--eg //int only can contain 11 size // space not allowed while definig the column name 
CREATE Table students_2(Id int(9)primary key, Name varchar(50)not null, Roll_No int(9)not null, City varchar(500));
-- Drop table // delete table
DROP Table [table_name];
-- To describe/see the table columns informtaion
DESC [table_name];
-- To get the table columns describes and see the constratints 
Show Create table [table_name]
-- To update the table structure // "add" more columns or "Drop" delete columns 
ALTER table [table_name] add phone int(9)not null;
ALTER table [table_name] drop Column [column_name];
--To modify the table "Modify" command
ALTER table [table_name] Modify [column_name] [DATATYPE][SIZE][EXTRA];
--To change the column name "RENAME Column" Available from the MySQL 8
ALTER table [table_name] RENAME Column [old_column_name] TO [new_column_name];

--Inserting data into table
INSERT INTO [table_name]([column_name]) VALUES ([Data_of_column]);
--2nd way
INSERT INTO VALUES([Data_of_column]);
--3rd way Inserting multiple values 
INSERT INTO [table_name]([column_name]) VALUES (),(),();

--UPDATE command //ID is important to uniqly indetify
UPDATE [table_name] SET [column_name] = [new_value] WHERE [column_name] = [value];
--To select mutiple columns 
UPDATE [table_name] SET [column_name] = [new_value], [] = [] WHERE [column_name] = [value];

--T0 Delete the whole table
DELETE FROM [table_name];
--TO Delete specific row from the table
DELETE FROM [table_name] where [column_name] = [value];

--ALIAS in SQL // It is aminly used in the joins to select specific columns by giving
--them temporaray name we can assign the temporary name to column using AS same for the table as well;
Select [column_name] AS [new_column_name], [][] from [table_name];
-- 2nd way 
Select [column_name] [new_column_name], [][] from [table_name] [temporaray_table_name];
--3rd way
select [temporaray_table_name].[column_name], [][] from [table_name][temporaray_table_name];


-- Select stament and restrictions on table using specific functions to get the data
-- WHERE, AND, OR, NOT
Select [column_name],[column_name] from [table_name] where [column_name] = [value];
-- return values if both condition are true  // we can use and 3 times
Select [column_name],[column_name] from [table_name] where [column_name] = [value] AND [column_name] = [value];
-- return all value if any of the conditions true // same 3 times
Select [column_name],[column_name] from [table_name] where [column_name] = [value] OR [column_name] = [value];
-- return all values excet the condition which should not be ture // same 3 times
Select [column_name],[column_name] from [table_name] where NOT [column_name] = [value];

--Orderby, Limit, Offset
--orderby
Select [column_name], [column_name] FROM [table_name] ORDER BY [column_name] asc/desc,[column_name] asc/desc;

--limit
Select [column_name],[column_name] FROM [table_name] Limit [any_number];

--offset // means how many row I want to leave // Limit how many rows I want
select [column_name], [column_name] from [table_name] LIMIT [any_number] offset [any_number];

--Aggregate functions
--AVG,SUM,COUNT

--count
Select COUNT([column_name]) from table_name where [column_name] = [value];

--Sum
Select SUM([column_name]) from table_name where [column_name] = [value];

--Average
Select AVERAGE([column_name]) from table_name where [column_name] = [value];



-- Group By and having 
-- having can only be used with group to provide the condition 
-- with simple select we only use the where clause 
-- Group by is used to count the number of repetitve values in a particular column 
-- we can perform many operation on thi like sum, average etc 

-- sample Table

SaleID	ProductID	Quantity	Price	SaleDate
1	    101	        5	        10.00	2024-06-01
2	    102	        3	        15.00	2024-06-01
3	    101	        2	        10.00	2024-06-02
4	    103	        1	        20.00	2024-06-03
5	    102	        7	        15.00	2024-06-03
--We want to find the total quantity sold and the total sales amount for each product, 
--but only for products that have sold more than 5 units in total.
--using GROUP BY and HAVING:

SELECT ProductID, 
       SUM(Quantity) AS TotalQuantity, 
       SUM(Quantity * Price) AS TotalSales
FROM Sales
GROUP BY ProductID
HAVING SUM(Quantity) > 5;

-- Answer 

ProductID	TotalQuantity	TotalSales
102	        10	            150.00

--String Functions in SQL 
-- we can create string using 2 ways with single '' quotation and double " " quotation
-- Length function / helps to get the length of the String
Select LENGTH([value]);
Select LENGTH([column_name]) FROM table_name where [column_name] = [value];
-- Also we can use alias as well.
Select LENGTH([column_name]) FROM table_name [other_condition like limit, offset];

-- Concat function / combine two strings
Select CONCAT([value], [value]);
Select CONCAT([column_name], [column_name]) FROM table_name where [column_name] = [value];
-- Also we can use alias as well.

-- LCASE to make the string in lower case
Select LCASE([value]);
Select LCASE([column_name]) FROM table_name where [column_name] = [value];
-- Also we can use alias as well.
Select LCASE([column_name]) FROM table_name [other_condition like limit, offset]; 

--UCASE to make the string in upper case
Select UCASE([value]);
Select UCASE([column_name]) FROM table_name where [column_name] = [value];
-- Also we can use alias as well.
Select UCASE([column_name]) FROM table_name [other_condition like limit, offset]; 

--SUBSTRING(str, length1, length2) index start from 1
Select SUBSTRING([value], Length1, Length2);
Select SUBSTRING([column_name], Length1, Length2) FROM table_name where [column_name] = [value];
-- Also we can use alias as well.
Select SUBSTRING([column_name], Length1, Length2) FROM table_name [other_condition like limit, offset]; 
-- Bonus Question by me /get the any column last entry with string value, that column have 
-- only last 2 letters in the caps
select concat(substring(first_name, 1, LENGTH(first_name) - 2), UCASE(substring(first_name, -2))) as name from employee order by first_name desc limit 1 offset 2;


-- Trim function / removes the spaces from the front and back of the string
Select Trim("     Hello");
Select Trim([column_name]) FROM table_name where [column_name] = [value];
-- Also we can use alias as well.
Select Trim([column_name]) FROM table_name [other_condition like limit, offset]; 

-- Reverse Function / reverse the string
Select Reverse("Hello");
Select Reverse([column_name]) FROM table_name where [column_name] = [value];
-- Also we can use alias as well.
Select Reverse([column_name]) FROM table_name [other_condition like limit, offset]; 

-- Compare 2 Strings
Select STRCMP("Hello", "Hello");
-- return values 
-- if str1 = str2, this function return 0
-- if str1 < str2, this function return -1
-- if str1 > str2, this function return 1


-- Other important functions

-- CURDATE / get the current date -- format YYYY-MM--DD
Select CURDATE(); 

-- CURTIME / get the current time -- format HH:MM:SS
Select CURTIME();

-- NOW() get the current date with current time -- format YYYT-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
Select NOW();

-- We can get only current year as well or day, month, I can own date as well " "
Select YEAR(CURDATE());
Select MONTH(CURDATE());
Select DAY(CURDATE());

-- We can get only current HH as well or MM, SS // I can pass own time as in " "
Select HOUR(CURTIME());
Select Minute(CURTIME());
Select SECOND(CURTIME());

-- if is condition we need to use ,
Select if(4<5, "YES","NO");
Select if([column_name], "YES", "NO") FROM table_name where [column_name] = [value];
-- Also we can use alias as well.
Select If([column_name], "YES", "NO") FROM table_name [other_condition like limit, offset]; 


-- IFNULL return the first value if it is not null otherwise return the second value
Select IFNULL(NULL, "HELLO");
-- anoher case
Select IFNULL("BHARAT", "Hello"); -- It will return Bharat  

-- DATABASE() / Return the current database
Select DATABASE();
-- VERSION() / Return the version of my sql server 
Select VERSION();
-- USER / return the user of the mysql
Select USER();

-- Math Function need to add by me https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_ref_sqlserver.asp


-- IN Operator / alternative of OR operator, to get multiple values to save the code line
Select * from table_name where [column_name] IN ([values]);

-- ** Like operator / can be use only with where
-- when we want to search the patern
-- eg name starting with letter a, ending with specific letter 
-- it can be whole word as well 
-- wildcards caharcter % -> Zero character, 1 character, more than onechar
-- _  -> only represent 1 charcter

Select * from [table_name] where [column_name] like "a%";
-- to see the if value is ending with specific letter
Select * from [table_name] where [column_name] like "%d";

-- _ we can use this if we want to the data after 2,3... more character
Select * from [table_name] where [column_name] like '__a%';
Select * from [table_name] where [column_name] like '_a%';

-- if we do not know what is in the front and at the back 
-- then we can use percentage at both side
select * from [table_name] where [column_name] like '%abc%';


-- Connecting the tables and performing joins
-- primary key -> unique & can not be null/ we can use more operation as well like AUTO_INCREMENT, DEFAULT, UNIQUE
-- Foregin Key this is key which is present in the main table and one column of this table 
-- will be present in another table as well

-- Cascading -- if anything delete from the parent table then 
-- it will delete the data related to that in child table
-- also we can use other properties as well which include "Nothing"

-- Also Foreign key ingnore all the work which will try to break the link
-- between the tables;

-- syntax foregin key creation
-- while creating the table we can add foregin key 
CREATE TABLE [table_name] ([column_name] [datatype]([size])[extra], .., 
[Foregin_column_name], Foreign KEY[(Foreign_column_name)] REFRENCES [parent_table_name][(parent_table_primary_key)]);

-- Foregin Key is constraints / we can add constraints later on and remove it as well
-- by adding column to the child table using alter command and then we can make column
-- as foregin key

-- add / Constraints are the set of rules or condition that are applied 
-- to the data to maintain its integrity, reliability & accuracy
ALTER table [table_name] ADD FOREIGN KEY [(column_name)] REFERENCES [parent_table_name][(parent_table_primary_key)];
-- another way
ALTER table [table_name] ADD constraints [column_name] FOREIGN KEY (column_name) REFERENCES [parent_table_name][(parent_table_primary_key)];

-- Dropping the foregin key
-- first we need to get the constratints of foreging key if we have assigned the CONSTRAINT
show create table [table_name];

-- once we get the constraint
alter table [table_name] drop FOREIGN KEY [constraint_name];

-- joins // whenever we do require to fetch the data from multiple tables together
-- then we use joins concept

-- simple join, equi join 
-- column name from diffrent table for 2 tables
Select e.[column_name], f.[column_name] from table_name1 e, table_name2 f where e.[column_name] = f.[column_name];  
-- for 3 tables equi join
Select e.[column_name], f.[column_name], g.[column_name] from table_name1 e, table_name2 f, table_name3 g where e.[column_name] = f.[column_name] AND e.[column_name] = g.[column_name];

-- Now implementing the iner join 
Select
e.[column_name],
e.[column_name],
f.[column_name],
g.[column_name]
FROM
table_name1 e
INNER JOIN 
table_name2 f ON e.[column_name] = f.[column_name]
INNER JOIN
table_name3 g ON e.[column_name] = g.[column_name]
EXTRA conditions using where; 

-- Left join means 
--> It contain innner join + it will give all infomation of left table 
--> even though if the matching column condition do not meet
Select
e.[column_name],
e.[column_name],
f.[column_name],
g.[column_name]
FROM
table_name1 e
LEFT JOIN 
table_name2 f ON e.[column_name] = f.[column_name]
EXTRA conditions using where; 

-- Same concept for right join 
Select
e.[column_name],
e.[column_name],
f.[column_name],
g.[column_name]
FROM
table_name1 e
Right JOIN 
table_name2 f ON e.[column_name] = f.[column_name]
EXTRA conditions using where; 

--Need the first_name, last_name of all employee 
--However I do require the all the information of laptop hold by employee
--& qualification hold by employee 
-- Practice
select 
e.first_name, e.last_name, l.model, q.q_name
from employee e
LEFT JOIN
employee_laptop l ON e.id = l.emp_id
LEFT JOIN
employee_qualification q ON e.id = q.emp_id;

-- full outer join, 
-- this join consist of Inner Join + Left Join + Right Join 
-- this join will return all the information which match the join condition + all the rest information 
-- which left table consist of + all the information which right table consist of 
-- this join is not possible in MY SQL 
-- However we can use this join in postgree sql 
-- we can use union to join 2 diffrent joins together below is EG
SELECT 
    e.first_name, 
    e.last_name, 
    l.laptop_name, 
    l.model
FROM 
    employee e
LEFT JOIN 
    employee_laptop l 
ON 
    e.id = l.emp_id
UNION
SELECT 
    e.first_name, 
    e.last_name, 
    l.laptop_name, 
    l.model
FROM 
    employee e
RIGHT JOIN 
    employee_laptop l 
ON 
    e.id = l.emp_id;

-- Cross Join/ it is the cartesian product of the table. 
-- if we applies this join then we will get output table1 rows X table2 rows
-- we do not need to define the join condition while using this join 

SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, l.laptop_name, l.model
from employee e
CROSS JOIN 
employee_laptop l;

-- Natural Join 
-- This join work same as the INNER JOIN if there is column that is present 
-- in the table1 have same as the column in table2 
-- Otherwise this join work as the Cross join if there is no column present in the table 
-- that have the same same 
-- Also we do not require any join condition to perform this join 
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, l.laptop_name, l.model
from employee e
NATURAL JOin
employee_laptop l;

-- Self join 










-- Data Import and export through My SQL work bench 
-- We can import the data in excel file as well / data which come as query result
-- We can user in the my sql and provide different access to that user.



-- further more in My SQL 
-- Store procedure

-- we can exceute multiple queries at a single time instead of excetuing them one by one 
-- we can create the batch of querries which will be known as store proceduce in which we can save 
--mutiple querries, and that store procedure will be save on the sql server directly ]

-- we can create variable, if else, loops and pass the parameter inside the stroe procedure 
-- we can not return any values when we pass the parameters 

-- Advantage of this 
-- it is use to reduce the traffic 
-- centralized the bussiness logic / only sql developer can write the querries and other developer can directly use the store procedure only
-- database become more secure 
-- we can manage user and provvide them specific access


-- we can change the delimiter in SQL 
-- Delimiter is the symbol from which the querry ends 
Delimiter  //


-- way to create the store procedure 
-- Now I am creating store procedure to create the table and then inserting two students below is the full syntax 
-- Values inside [] are dynamic. 

create procedure [createUserTable()]
    -> begin
    -> create table if not exists [students](
    -> [students_id] int primary key auto_increment, 
    -> [first_name] varchar(20) not null,
    -> [last_name] varchar(20) not null,
    -> [city] varchar(15) not null
    -> );
    -> insert into students (first_name, last_name, city) values ("Jennifer", "Dalal", "London");
    -> insert into students (first_name, last_name, city) values ("Ola", "Lola", "Africa");
    -> select * from students;
    -> end//
